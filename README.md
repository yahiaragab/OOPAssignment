# Assignment 1: Premier League Tables


This Processing sketch displays details about teams in the English Barclays Premier League. I chose this dataset, because football is a very big part of my life, because I'm Chelsea through and through, and since it's something I know a lot about already, I thought I would enjoy doing it as it would only add to my knowledge, and it would be easy to spot mistakes since I'm familiar already with this data.

The BPL sketch displays data such as:
- All Time Table
- All Team's Goals Stats
- All Team's Points Stats
- Individual Team Goal Stats
- Individual Team Points Stats
- How money has affected the league since 2003 (The arrival of Roman Abramovich)
- And more!

The sketch gives the user the option to search for details about every team that has played in the barclays permier league since 1992 (The year the league started), and display them in a way that is easy to understand.

I really enjoyed writing this sketch because I learned a lot from it programming-wise, and football-wise. #KTBFFH
